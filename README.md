Due to the complexity of the program there might not always immediatly emerge complex behaviour:
restart the simulation by pressing the y key, around 1/3 of the simulations creates complex behaviour. You can zoom in and out using scroll, and return to original zoom by pressing the r key,
and pan the view using the arrow keys. You can speed and slow time using i and j keys and exit using the escape key.

Made with SDL2/sdl.h (it only uses the drawpoint function to draw circles in visual.c and program.c, and window handling)

To compile this:
compile the program.c file with SDL2 and math

Windows ( http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/codeblocks/ )

Made on Kali Linux USB with gcc and SDL2

To set the Screen size change SCREEN_X and SCREEN_Y in constants.h

This still needs some tweeking and optimizing.
