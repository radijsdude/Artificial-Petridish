Artificial life

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wZrSxnUp4k&feature=youtu.be

Made with SDL2/sdl.h (it only uses the drawpoint function to draw circles in visual.c and program.c, and window handling)

To compile this:
compile the program.c file with SDL2 and math

Windows ( http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/codeblocks/ )

Made in Kali Linux with gcc and SDL2

To set the Screen size change SCREEN_X and SCREEN_Y in constants.h

This still needs some tweeking and optimizing.
